 *
 * 63. Unique Paths II
 *
 * Follow up for "Unique Paths":
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 * An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 *
 * For example,
 * There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
 * [
 *  [0,0,0],
 *  [0,1,0],
 *  [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * The total number of unique paths is 2.
 *
 * Note: m and n will be at most 100.
 *
 * 分析：参考62题思路。
